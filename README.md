                Local storage integration refers to the incorporation of a web browser's local storage capabilities into a website or web application. Local storage allows you to store data locally on a user's device, typically in the form of key-value pairs, without the need for a server. This can be useful for caching data, saving user preferences, and improving the performance of your web application</p>

               <p> A pie chart is a circular chart that displays data as a set of slices, or "pie wedges," to represent the proportion of each category within a dataset. Pie charts are commonly used to visualize data where the parts contribute to a whole, and you want to show the relative size of each part in relation to the whole.</p>
